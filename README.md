# Odetta

### About

Odetta is a group messaging platform built to connect students with their professors and classmates outside of office hours and class time. Odetta builds on standard messaging applications by allowing the instructor to organize discussions across classes and sections by creating unlimited rooms.

Odetta is fully responsive, meaning it looks just as good on a desktop as it does on a mobile device. It also features distributed systems protocols like heartbeart analysis to ensure participants in the chatroom are active.

Odetta is being open-sourced in the hope that a new developer can use it as a jumping off point for building her own application. This is a development build. Many important features are missing or under construction. The project is not currently under active development but feedback and pull requests are welcome.

### Initialization

First, create and populate a database using include/init.sql. Next, insert your new credentials into include/dbconn.php.

### Instructions

Create an instructor account through /office to start creating chatrooms. Ensure that your instructor account corresponds to a school id for the chatrooms to be visible to students via the homepage. This step must be performed manually or through a targeted query.
